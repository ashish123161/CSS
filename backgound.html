        <p>When folks come to us for blogging advice, we generally direct them to start out by focusing on who their target audience is. You could call this demographic information, but to me its much more than that. Its about getting to know your audience on a personal level: who they are, what movies they watch, what social platforms they gravitate towards, what makes them laugh and, most importantly, how can you help them, entertain them, and just plain be real with them.</p><br>
        Creating a blog that people actually want to read and share is a challenge that every online marketer faces, day in and day out. The mediums evolve, the customers grow up, and the industry changes on a daily basis.
